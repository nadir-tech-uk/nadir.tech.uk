## About Me
I am an IT professional actively seeking entry-level IT Support, Service Desk Analyst, or Application Support roles, with a clear, structured career path toward cloud, systems, and infrastructure technologies.

I bring 5+ years of professional experience as a Software & Mobile Application Developer (Android, React Native, iOS), providing a strong technical foundation in troubleshooting, debugging, systems thinking, and root-cause analysis—skills that transfer naturally into technical support, service desk, and application support environments.

Over the past year, I have been intentionally re-skilling and building hands-on capability in technologies essential to modern IT support teams, including:
* IT Support & Service Desk operations (incidents, requests, SLAs, escalation) 🛠️
* Windows administration & Active Directory (lab-based) 🔑
* Linux fundamentals & Bash scripting 🐧
* Python programming & automation 🐍
* SQL (MySQL & PostgreSQL) 🗄️
* Cloud fundamentals (Azure & AWS) ☁️

Alongside my technical journey, my professional experience in UK healthcare and support roles has strengthened my customer communication, incident handling, documentation, teamwork, and ability to remain calm under pressure—all critical qualities for front-line IT Support and Service Desk roles.

I am currently focused on securing a first UK-based IT Support or Service Desk position, where I can contribute from day one, continue learning within a structured environment, and progress steadily into cloud, systems administration, and security-focused roles over time.

📍 UK-based (Wales)

✅ Eligible to work in the UK — no sponsorship required
